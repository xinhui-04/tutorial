        <h1>Metro Tomyam Shop</h1>
        <p>
            Established in 2015, Metro Tomyam Shop has been a local favorite in Taman Melawati, offering premium flavors from a humble roadside setting. Our shop may look like your typical neighborhood stall, but the food we serve is anything but ordinary. Our signature tomyam, crafted with fresh, high-quality ingredients and bold, aromatic spices, delivers an upscale dining experience without the upscale price tag.
